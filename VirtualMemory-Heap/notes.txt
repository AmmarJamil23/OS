Virtual Memory Address ==> Each process has its own isolated address range.
Heap ==> Memory area for dynamic allocations (malloc, new)
Stack ==> Memory area for function calls and local varaibles.
brk(), sbrk() ==> Syscalls used by the C library to expand or shrink the heap.
mmap() ==> Syscall to map large chunks of memory directly into the address space.
Fragmentation ==> Memory gaps created when allocations and frees are irregular.


Virtual memory gives every process the illusion fo infinite space , each with its own address range (0x00000000-0xFFFFFFFF).
The heap grows dynamically upward as your program allocates more meory. The stack grows downward => they meet only in memory-heavy programs.


malloc() requests memory from the OS via brk() or mmap() syscalls.
 For small allocations => brk() (contiguous heap expansion)
 For large allocations => mmap() (page-aligned memory mapping).
 
Memory gragmentation can occur over time as allocations and frees leave gaps that is important in long-running systems.
