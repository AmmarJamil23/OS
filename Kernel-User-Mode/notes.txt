How the OS protects itself and our programs using privilege levels => Kernel and User Mode.

The Problem it solves:
Imagine a buggy video player that accidently tries to write data directly to your disk controller or kernel memory.
WIthout restrictions, one crash in that app could bring down the entire operating system.
=> The OS must isolate and protect itself and that is exactly what user mode and kernel mode are for.

CORE CONCEPT:
Imagine a company
The kernel => is top management (it can access everything (files, memory, hardware).
User Programs => are employees (they can make only requests to management.
==> To make a request, employees submit a form (system call).
The manager checks it, perform the action , and returns a result.
