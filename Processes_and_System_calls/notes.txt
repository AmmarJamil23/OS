If our program need to read a file, start another program ,or open a network socket, we can do these core tasks securely by using system calls 
systemcalls => controlled doorways from user space.

Process => A running program with its own virtual address space.
fork() => duplicate the current process.
exec() => replace the current process image with a new program.
