# Operating System
This repository contains all my Operating System practice work and concepts.
Each folder covers an important OS topic such as processes, system calls, scheduling, memory management, virtual memory, file system I/O, interprocess communication, and threads with synchronization.
I created small programs and tasks to understand how operating systems work internally.
The purpose of this repo is to strengthen my OS fundamentals through hands-on implementation and experiments.
