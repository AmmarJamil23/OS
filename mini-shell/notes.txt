By creating the mini--shell we will
=> Understand how shells use system calls to manage processes.
=> IMplement command parsing, frk/exec execution, and waiting for child prcoesses.
=> Support simple built-in commands (cd, exit).
=> See how pipes (|) and redirection (>, < ) could be added later.

Every time we type :
ls -l 

the shell:
1- Reads our command from input
2- Parses it into executable and arguments.
3- Creates a new process (fork());
4- Runs the command (exec())
5- Wait for it to finish (wait())

Core Concept (Analogy)
Think fo the shell as a conductor in a orchestra.
=> The shell does not make the music itself, it just coordinates musicians (processes).
=> Each command you type is a musician who plays independently.
=> The shell's job is to start, stop, and monitor them , safely and in sync.


Pipes and direction allows one process to talk to another through their outputs and inputs.

Pipes:
Think of pipes as tubes connecting two machines
=> Machine A writes to the pipe.
=> Machine B reads from it.

Redirection is like plugging one end of the tube into a file instead of another process.
Pipe => Tube between processes
Redirection (>, <) => Redirects input/output to/from files.
