Interrupts are a concept that allows the OS handles real-time events efficiently.
Analogy:
Think of the CPU as a teacher in a classroom(executing instructions).
A student (hardware device) raises their hand.
The teacher pauses teching and listens to the student (handles the interupt).
After answering, the teacher resumes exactly where they left off.
